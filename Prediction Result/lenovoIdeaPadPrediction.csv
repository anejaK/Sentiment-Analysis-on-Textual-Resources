"This laptop is not the most powerful thing you'll use, but for $250, it's excellent for Office applications and basic internet browsing like checking your email and watching 720p/1080p videos (1080p video stutters a little bit on some websites), and the SSD really makes a HUGE difference in performance, it boots up in a couple of seconds, and everything feels snappy even though the CPU is kinda weak and it only has 4GB of RAM.The Battery life is okay for a laptop this cheap (I got around 3 hours of heavy use on a full charge), and the charger is so small it can fit in your pocket.The 0.3mp webcam is absolute trash though, so if you're planning on video chatting with this thing, don't buy it.EDIT: I forgot to mention that it comes with Windows 10 Home in S-Mode, but you can easily disable S-Mode for free by going into ""Settings"" -> ""Update & Security"" -> ""Activation"" -> Select ""Go to the Store."" under ""Switch to Windows 10 Home "" -> click ""Get""

"Replaced a Dell basic laptop that was a few years old but ran windows 10. My dell died when the keyboard drank a cup of coffee: >) So I found this laptop for 250.00 on Amazon and I must say it is as good or better then the Dell. I am happy so far with the laptop it even has a DVD player which most are dropping. I don't watch DVD's but do use the player to record data to DVD's like photos and other data. I don't game online so can't say it is good for that probably not first pick for that but as a general use for people like me who mostly read emails and news online it is perfect!

"For $250 this is a powerful and fast machine. Does all the basics like email, web searching, Facebook, excel. I really got it to play online games that require more intense graphics and gameplay. I am very happy with its value. I bought one with only 4Gb RAM from A local retail store for $200 but it was super slow. This Lenovo also starts right up after a reboot.  Well worth the money.

"For $250 this is a powerful and fast machine. Does all the basics like email, web searching, Facebook, excel. I really got it to play online games that require more intense graphics and gameplay. I am very happy with its value. I bought one with only 4Gb RAM from A local retail store for $200 but it was super slow. This Lenovo also starts right up after a reboot.  Well worth the money.

"This laptop is not the most powerful thing you'll use, but for $250, it's excellent for Office applications and basic internet browsing like checking your email and watching 720p/1080p videos (1080p video stutters a little bit on some websites), and the SSD really makes a HUGE difference in performance, it boots up in a couple of seconds, and everything feels snappy even though the CPU is kinda weak and it only has 4GB of RAM.The Battery life is okay for a laptop this cheap (I got around 3 hours of heavy use on a full charge), and the charger is so small it can fit in your pocket.The 0.3mp webcam is absolute trash though, so if you're planning on video chatting with this thing, don't buy it.EDIT: I forgot to mention that it comes with Windows 10 Home in S-Mode, but you can easily disable S-Mode for free by going into ""Settings"" -> ""Update & Security"" -> ""Activation"" -> Select ""Go to the Store."" under ""Switch to Windows 10 Home "" -> click ""Get""

"Replaced a Dell basic laptop that was a few years old but ran windows 10. My dell died when the keyboard drank a cup of coffee: >) So I found this laptop for 250.00 on Amazon and I must say it is as good or better then the Dell. I am happy so far with the laptop it even has a DVD player which most are dropping. I don't watch DVD's but do use the player to record data to DVD's like photos and other data. I don't game online so can't say it is good for that probably not first pick for that but as a general use for people like me who mostly read emails and news online it is perfect!
