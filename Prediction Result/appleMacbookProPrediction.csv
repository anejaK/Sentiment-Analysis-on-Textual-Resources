" I bought this laptop on February 2019, it worked fine for one month then it started giving trouble. As soon as I open laptop screen flickers. once close and then open works fine. I wanted to return this laptop but it already passed 30 days (I am a elite member). I called apple support they did some diagnostics and ran some tests and said every thing is fine. Again after few day saw the same problem. Called Apple support again, they ask me to take this to local store. I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue. This time i went to local apple store ask for the replacement. That technician was so rude ,he said he can service it but can't replace. the worst service worst laptop. Never ever spend too much of money on this carp. Please don't recommend this product to your friends and family.

"I got my Macbook from Best Buy about 5 months ago and I love it. I have no had any issue with it so far, the butterfly keyboard issues have yet to happen to me, the computer is super fast and its great for use as a programmer.

"Love it! This is the lowest price I find for the newest MacBook Pro 2019. Review after two months of use.Amazing screen, the True Tone technology is very useful. The Touch Bar is easier to use than what I thought. The only thing is the battery life is not as long as I expected (7 hours maximum for normal use)

"I purchased this and delivered to Sri Lanka through my friend in USA. When I try to use Type C usb to work with my external hard, got to know those ports are not working.All 4 ports works only for charger and for nothing else.When I go to Apple store here, they only do repairs and not replacements. So amazon sold me a faulty product in a sealed box and now Apple only does repairs.After paying all that much for this so called premium product, really disappointed.

"Wanted to like this laptop but I couldn’t get the issues with the Touch Bar to stop especially with non Apple apps. Using Chrome I had no way to turn up the volume or adjust brightness as all the touchbar would show is function keys. The keyboard is just awful. It’s like typing on a glass surface.

"I was pretty skeptical after reading the other reviews, but the price was pretty good and Amazon has always been a secure source to buy from, so I ordered mine Friday, it came today. I got exactly what I paid for, I'm definitely happy with the purchase. Not going into specific details about the laptop itself because there's a million other detailed reviews of it on YouTube, mainly just writing a review to explain my purchase experience.

"Phenomenal device. First practically priced offering that does not lack specs from Apple. The usual shell out a boatload vs. shorting yourself on specs battle is over. Unless you are a professional editing media, this MBP is will be sufficient. Snappy, well built, great screen, everything you expect from an Apple OSX device.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

When I try to use Type C usb to work with my external hard, got to know those ports are not working.All 4 ports works only for charger and for nothing else.When I go to Apple store here, they only do repairs and not replacements.

I got exactly what I paid for, I'm definitely happy with the purchase.

"Phenomenal device. First practically priced offering that does not lack specs from Apple. The usual shell out a boatload vs. shorting yourself on specs battle is over.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

When I try to use Type C usb to work with my external hard, got to know those ports are not working.All 4 ports works only for charger and for nothing else.When I go to Apple store here, they only do repairs and not replacements. So amazon sold me a faulty product in a sealed box and now Apple only does repairs.After paying all that much for this so called premium product, really disappointed.

"Phenomenal device. First practically priced offering that does not lack specs from Apple. The usual shell out a boatload vs. shorting yourself on specs battle is over. Unless you are a professional editing media, this MBP is will be sufficient. Snappy, well built, great screen, everything you expect from an Apple OSX device.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is.

Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

Again after few day saw the same problem. Called Apple support again, they ask me to take this to local store. I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue. This time i went to local apple store ask for the replacement. That technician was so rude ,he said he can service it but can't replace. the worst service worst laptop. Never ever spend too much of money on this carp. Please don't recommend this product to your friends and family.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

I wanted to return this laptop but it already passed 30 days (I am a elite member). I called apple support they did some diagnostics and ran some tests and said every thing is fine. Again after few day saw the same problem. Called Apple support again, they ask me to take this to local store. I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue.

It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

I wanted to return this laptop but it already passed 30 days (I am a elite member). I called apple support they did some diagnostics and ran some tests and said every thing is fine. Again after few day saw the same problem. Called Apple support again, they ask me to take this to local store. I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue. This time i went to local apple store ask for the replacement. That technician was so rude ,he said he can service it but can't replace. the worst service worst laptop. Never ever spend too much of money on this carp. Please don't recommend this product to your friends and family.

Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine.

Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around.

"Phenomenal device. First practically priced offering that does not lack specs from Apple. The usual shell out a boatload vs. shorting yourself on specs battle is over.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

I wanted to return this laptop but it already passed 30 days (I am a elite member). I called apple support they did some diagnostics and ran some tests and said every thing is fine. Again after few day saw the same problem. Called Apple support again, they ask me to take this to local store. I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue. This time i went to local apple store ask for the replacement. That technician was so rude ,he said he can service it but can't replace. the worst service worst laptop. Never ever spend too much of money on this carp. Please don't recommend this product to your friends and family.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks.

"Wanted to like this laptop but I couldn’t get the issues with the Touch Bar to stop especially with non Apple apps. Using Chrome I had no way to turn up the volume or adjust brightness as all the touchbar would show is function keys. The keyboard is just awful. It’s like typing on a glass surface.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other.

I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other.

This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.

I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue. This time i went to local apple store ask for the replacement. That technician was so rude ,he said he can service it but can't replace. the worst service worst laptop.

The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly.

" I bought this laptop on February 2019, it worked fine for one month then it started giving trouble. As soon as I open laptop screen flickers. once close and then open works fine. I wanted to return this laptop but it already passed 30 days (I am a elite member). I called apple support they did some diagnostics and ran some tests and said every thing is fine. Again after few day saw the same problem. Called Apple support again, they ask me to take this to local store. I took it to Troy Somerst store. technician completely serviced and said he fixed the problem. after a week again I have got the same issue.

When I try to use Type C usb to work with my external hard, got to know those ports are not working.All 4 ports works only for charger and for nothing else.When I go to Apple store here, they only do repairs and not replacements.

"Phenomenal device. First practically priced offering that does not lack specs from Apple. The usual shell out a boatload vs. shorting yourself on specs battle is over.

"The first mac that was delivered to me was faulty out the box. It would shut off at around 63% and the battery percentage would jump around. I thought it was just bad luck and so I exchanged it for another one and the one I'm using now runs fine. This is a good laptop if you're a college student because it's lightweight and the charger isn't a 10kg brick like some other laptops have. It easy to carry and can last you the whole day. i've always used PC laptops but I decided to give this mac a try because of how lightweight it is. Some basic pros and cons of this laptop are:Pros--Very small and lightweight while remaining sturdy. Screen real-estate isn't compromised because of how small the mac is, the screen is very bright and has very deep colors. Solid metal chaise keeps the laptop feeling nice with no flex from pressure.-Touch ID is really nice for getting back into your laptop without the password.-TouchBar can be useful when you need to change a setting quickly and it can be customized.-The trackpad and the gestures are very fluid and really makes the whole experience a breeze.-Siri is nice for asking for the weather and that's about it.Cons--The base model comes with 128 GB which is very small for a $1300 laptop. Apple is cheapening out on the memory here but luckily there is iCloud storage.-Keys can get annoying to type on, they have a short travel time and it doesn't feel nice after a while.-The 2 usb-c ports are too close to each other. I tried plugging in a usb-c to usb adapter and the charger and it wouldn't fit, they were pushing against each other. The adapter itself isn't large but I think the 2 ports should be separated a bit more.-No USB port, nobody is going to stop using usb for a while so having to carry an adaptor just to use your flash drive gets annoying.-No dedicated esc key, If the TouchBar fails for whatever reason then there's no easy way to press esc. I wish they shortened the TouchBar to make room for a physical esc key.-Kinda expensive for what the specs are, if you enjoy macbooks for more than just the hardware then this wouldn't bother you, but spending this amount for 128 GB ssd and a quad-core i5 is a joke. The base model 13 macbookpro should have at least 512GB ssd.

"I ordered this about a week ago and it was working great. However, once the battery power got to around 20%, it would shut off unexpectedly. I reset the SMC and NVRAM, but the same problem persisted. I took it to the Apple Store and they told me the battery was fine, but there was an issue with the logic board and recommended I get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and got a second MacBook the next day and the SAME PROBLEM happened with the battery and unexpected shutdowns. I'm now returning for a refund.I normally love Apple products and own a bunch already with no problems. However, I can't recommend this particular model since I've had the same defect in consecutive MacBooks. It could be a software issue that can be fixed with a patch, or possibly a manufacturer defect that will end in a recall. Either way, I'd hold off.
