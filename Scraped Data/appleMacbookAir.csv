1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It  suddenly stopped working twice in span of 1.5 yrs. I am unable to switch it on. After three months of purchase, I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. Luckily it was in the warranty. Now again after a eight month of replacement, it's dead again. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this for my mother, she is a prolific writer / poet and spends a ton of time on computers these days as a result. She has had fairly bad experiences with build quality, frequent hardware issues with other brands in the past and so wanted a good sturdy sleak laptop, this was a perfect  fit for her, especially now that the price was reasonably low and discounted, it was a no-brainer.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"For a full year until the warranty was valid, this MacBook Air worked like a charm. Then it died. No response to power button. No internal mechanical movement. The laptop is just dead. I gave it for repair at an Apple authorized service center and they told me it was a failed Power Section and IC. I paid Rs. 13,300 for replacement and service charge of these parts only for the laptop to run fine for a couple of days and then die out in th same way. The dealer says I would have to pay the same amount to get the parts replaced again with no guarantees that the issue won't turn up again. Never trusting an Apple product again. For such a rich money hogging brand, they offer the shoddiest quality of service and products ever."
1.0 out of 5 stars,It did not run properly for even a week...it is on service centre from 20 days

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this product in February 2018 from Amazon. The power button started giving problems in end-May 2019. The computer just would not startup. I scanned the Net for such problems.  A lot of work arounds: push the Start button+ shift button etc. This worked for a few days. Then such work around too stopped working at all - the computed refused to start-up once shut down. Surprisingly, I ran the computer diagnostics on the Macbook, and the diagnostics program could not find any defect! I was surprised that even if the program could not find a defect on the computer, yet the computer once shut down would not start up.Secondly, finding a  Macbook authorised service center too is an onerous task in India. The Service center informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. And it needs to be replaced. Wow! Next time I would stick to my windows notebook, would never purchase a Macbook again!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was shocked to received a defective Apple MacBook. The device was not booting. Amazon was prompt in sending service Engineer, who certified the item defective. This item was replaced with a brand new MacBook as per Amazon policy. However to my dismay, this new MacBook also had a similar defect, which was again certified by the service Engineer. Apple is the world leader in laptops, and what amazes me is the 'QC' or the lack of it.Finally I had to request Amazon to refund the amount, which they did.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"well I have been using a windows laptop in the premium category for quiet some time.most of my time was spent dealing with driver issues with oem manufacturers, colossal problem with heating, os stutter in a 16 gb ram machine.i decide the pros and cons and again switched back to MacBook Air .1)the trackpad works like a dream.not like horrible windows with lag and stutter.multi gesture is a dream2) admittedly the display is not hd.but trust me much better than the much touted hd displays of horrific windows laptops I have used.in the same price range3)I am not a video editor but I am sure high end editing on 4k etc will be a challenge.but routine like image editing etc will be not an issue.if vfx pro etc is your daily grime look the Mac book pro4)routine work is a breeze..like..so cool the intuitive..experience...more so if you are in to the experience of apple ecosystem..airdrop etc...is very easy to comprehend5)the built quality and the battery is simply superb.here the low res display helps in easily 10-11 hours of usage.and 2 weeks of standby6)it is lighter and slimmer even than the new MacBook Air.7)no other MacBook has the glowing apple logo if it means much to you.maybe a collectible later:-)8)daily tasks are a breeze..however high end gaming will take a hit..tip:try and go for the extended warranty...at an apple store/apple protection plan"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:Air demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Stopped working before I could repay the EMI's. Just after the warranty expired, the laptop refused to turn on. Apple repair center asks Rs 43000 for spare part. I am throwing it in trash and never buying an apple product again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing product..it has quality written all over it..great battery, easy to adapt if you are moving from windows..the trackpad, gestures, everything is so damm goodHad read many reviews about the display being bad...it is..if you are trying to look at atomic level details..its a fantastic screen with great audio output..Everything g screams quality and premium about the macbook..love it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,From the very beginning the battery life was horrible . hardly 2 hours. And after using it for just a year it just stopped working . and i cannot even charge it. Terrible product sold by Amazon
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The rating isn't for Apple's performance. I exchanged my old MacBook Air 11' (2013) for MacBook Air 13.3' (2017): and I haven't been disappointed. They both are fantastic machines, there isn't a bit of change except the screen - it is slightly bigger and better...The rating for the seller - I would give 5 star for delivery and 4 star for packaging. However, the product came with multiple scratches. I am unable to conclude whose fault it is- Apple or the reseller (in this case - Cloudtail India Pvt Ltd).I have restored my previous backup and will observe the performance over the week. If it under performs- I will report it to the authorities. If it performs well, the scratches may have been anyone's fault but can be ignored...I shall update this review in a week's time..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I preferred this over other good spec windows laptop, just for reason mac. 128 gb ssd was only concern as it may not be sufficient however adding external hd or flash drive will do the job for u. Overall even the screen is not full hd i did not find it much of the issue, however If u r concern about good display must for consider this as option. Additionaly over 13000 discount in last sale made this perfect deal."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When i received, within 15 days i realised the hinges were loose. Then after less than 2 months very rare use i got a line on the display. The replacement window was only 10 days. Now i have given it for service and even apple doesn't have a replacement policy. So i have to use a repaired device inspite of buying new. Very disappointing."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Be careful while buying electronic products through Amazon.I bought this macbook for 56k on March 2018. After 1.5 years of usage, the display stopped working for no reason. The device never had any accidental drop or shock while I was using it through these years. The service center guy told me it would cost around 41k for screen replacement. Now I'm left with no option.If you are buying, I suggest you to buy it along with a protection plan or any extended warranty."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The elegant work of apple can be seen in this product. The design, the user friendliness, the compactness can be easily seen in this laptop. Coming to the performance, the speed of this is remarkable, and you can get to know the power of Mac os when you have another apple product. You can get one of the best movie experiences on this . Overall I would it a 4.5/5."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi, Think thousand time before buying. One calm night i was cuddling in jaipuri blanket while enjoying youtube on this expensive machine. Cold night and little excitement created electrostatic charge which spike though spaceBar button. that's how it went to deep sleep forever. Nothing can bring it back and i am in no mood in spending another fortune on this machine. Apple, of you (i)care, this is the least of security feature included in all electronic devices. And the best part, it was a week after Warranty expiration date.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you're not doing any hardcore processing work like coding, video editing. MacBook Air is best for the normal everyday life use.- very good battery life- amazing OS- nice sound and video quality- processor is old but it do the work for basic tasks and doesn't heat up.If its in your budget go for it you wouldn't regret it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Never purchase any Apple products. I bought 3 and start giving problems just after 6 months. I need to visit 4 times service station which is far 12 km. Again MacBook start acting dead after 6 more months. Mean a top priced laptop giving problems in every 6 months.I have good experiences with other brands of laptops. I hope this comment can help to save somebody’s money.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought MacBook air in 2017, it was working fine till last month. It suddenly stopped charging I took it apple care and was shocked to hear the feedback. They told me that the motherboard is dead and i have to buy a new motherboard. The cost was 50k ( i bought at 53k in 2017). We buy Apple products because they are meant to be long-lasting. I am really disappointed and would prefer other companies next time. They earn extra money from selling an extended warranty."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it on 9th July, stopped working / not turning power on by 4th Nov. Adding to this disappointment is - Apple's refusal to repair it under warranty stating that there is corrosion in Logic Board. Amazon also did not help. The seller - Appario - does not like to be bothered with it. Sometimes I wonder if buying electronics online is a good idea!"

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Apple,apple,apple, thats the first thing that must have flashed in you mind when you saw this product, so here i have a total breif review on the laptop...***Pros***4k Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X on this thing works like butter, there is heating issue that i am going to go to apple service center to get it checkedEveryday works like checking mail and is just gr8The Battery is just OVERPOWERED, works for around 11-12 hours on continuous work and 8-9 hours when editingThe graphics card scores 30 fps in cinebench which is not that badThe performance is also fine, 280 cb processor score on cinebenchSpeakers are really good with perfect bassDisplay brightness is 300 nits, which is fineThe Wi-Fi is extremely good, can get a network even from the living room while the router is in the bedroomVery thin and lightweightMacOS is good for School work if you know all the office applications for mac, for eg.Pages is WordMagSafe 2 is the best partGood Trackpad and Keyboard with backlightThe Storage is fast!, thanks to the M.2 based SSD!***Cons***Display, though the resolution is fairly good for a 13.3 inch display, the viewing angle is not appropriate for a 84k laptopGets heated up (Going to get it checked by apple support). Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is enough to edit 4k60fps videos but will slow down a bit in 5k60fps! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Couldn't have received a better laptop. Look Macs aren't for gaming.  So don't expect good gameplay. but if you really wanna get a performance, it will have it for you with a little heating.it surfs like a beast. if you do casual stuff like browsing or typing, you will be surprised. the fans rarely kick in.The battery is a bomb! Provides service all around the day with medium brightness. takes around 2-3 hrs to charge and man the safe charging system rocks. you will never tip off the mac.Editing is managed like a magical spell. no issue at all. BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO SERVE LIKE A MACBOOK PRO, IT'S AIR.in terms of style, man it will rock you. Trust me, You won't regret."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"So after a year of using it, unfortunately the smc chip and memory synchronisation is at fault. There is no manual resetting that works and the only option is to get the chips replaced which costs around 19k. So much for long lasting. Though I must say it worked like a pro for 1 year and now its time to bury it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product was dead in just one and half years. Apple service is great experience but they charged Rs 2600 for checking the machine and asked another fifty-five thousand rupees for replacing the battery and board which was found to have ""issues"".

Battery life is amazing, I use it daily for almost 2-4 hrs and I charge it only once in 2-3 days.3. Finger gestures are amazing.4. Speed ❤️. No lags whatsoever.Cons:1. Apple should have updated the 2017 MacBook with Retina display, although this display is works perfectly fine.2. To use some applications, you've to buy them. Can not use cracked version unlike windows.If you're looking for a laptop (non-gaming) within 50-60k budget which you want to use it for long term, buy this one."

5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is really good. When it comes to Apple taking it's laptop makes a lot more sense than taking iphone because1. Battery life of mac-book is 10-12 hrs while normal HP laptop is just 3-5 hrs.2. Sound quality is amazing3. No extra installation or upgrades required like Windows4. Comparatively virus free

4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice laptop. Had got it for ₹44000/- just for the laptop without exchanging any old ones. Feels a little outdated now but still ok if available for around ₹44k else go for any other laptop. Display is a let down & the bezels are really boring to look at. It's an old processor but decent for normal day to day use.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using Windows Operating system for the past 10+ years, I switched to Mac. The switch was inspired by the awesome reviews I got from my friends. I must say that they were all real and that the device and the tech is so very impressive. Be it the design,  be it the processing speed, be it the battery life......all are way ahead than that of a Windows device. I am satisfied to get the marvel of a tech in my hands. It is saving my time every now and then as I am stricken with an idea to pen a couplet, short story or poem.....I simply open the lid, note the idea and then simply close it....no need of shutting the OS down everytime. Working perfectly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"MacBook Air is excellent. The build is super strong, the operating systems runs smooth. The trackpad and keyboard are great. The only thing that can be improved is its screen (the visuals). Not as good as expected. The hard disk is too small but if you carry an external hard disk you can solve that problem. Got it at the price of a Dell Windows laptop during Amazon sale. A great deal.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very handy laptop, light weight and portable. Mac OS is super cool. Battery backup was good. Defective product recieved,within 2 months of use, laptop gets switched off suddenly while on battery. Requires power input to restart again.Contacted service centre, they told its motherboard problem and replaced motherboard under warranty, but problem still persisting. Laptop still at service center. Earlier i was using toshiba laptop, satellite 340,lasted 8 yrs without any problem. Paid a premium for macbook air very dissapointed with apple quality of products. And to repair it outside warranty, parts cost as much as the laptop itself🙄"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold. However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no. All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent. Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device. Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much."

Except for not so good sound quality while watching movies through itunes stores, other aspect seems to be fine. Higher storage options (256 GB) may be required for power users who may want to app development on this system. Current configuration suits light - medium heavy user(I belong to this category)- (need xcode debugging feature for my projects )."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this. I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense. I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the worst  apple product I have ever seen ...6 month After purchase of this fake book ...some of its keys of keyboard  stopped working ...So the service center  replace my keyboard with the new one ...But after some months with  the new replaced  keyboard some of its key again stopped working .All these things happen in one year and 3 month timeline which is roughly 1.5 years of original purchase date ... ...When I spoke to the service center they told me that the warranty is over you need to pay 12000 rs ...So I don't have any option. The cost is too high. ..So now I m working with the external keyboard which cost me merely 200 rs ... My friend bought the same macbook from the showroom and i must say its really working good and it doesnt show any fault at all .Till now .i wish i also bought this macbook from the showroom ....
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don’t keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed by the product quality. After carefully using for 2 years my device stared giving me problem. As soon as welcome screen appears and I key in my credentials screen turns to green and lines all over it.

Did SMC, PRAM and checked with known good power adapter - Still same issue, Checked internal condition - found liquid damage and corrosion marks on logic board. Hence Logic board need to replace the logic board under exchange price to check further. customer denied service .""  and overall repair charge was 48950 rs.

So I backed out and was using a USB keyboard. Now the whole system is not switching On. Took to local service center it has costed me 3,500 to just make it work again and still will cost more to make the keyboard replaced. Truly gutted. I have my HP laptop pro book almost 9 years old still running without any issues. Was planning to buy an IPhone but surely not after this. Deeply sad by the experience."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The MacBook is good in-terms of what it is designed for. The laptop is light weight so no hassle while carrying during travels. The backlit keyboard is a good advantage to work in low light. The performance is good, I use it for game development and I have not faced any problems until now. The transition from Windows to Mac was easy, not much of a hassle, initial few days, to understand the shortcut keys and how to operate will be little bit slow, post that it is just a breeze. Many applications are supported, no issue in bluetooth or USB connectivity or WIFI connectivity.

Not sure what to do with my MacBook Air....it cost more to repair than a decent windows laptop.I will never buy any apple product in future...the cost to repair are extremely very high..
1.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the worst product i have ever bought. The screen will get fade out after the end of the product warranty. You wouldn't have any option rather taking the laptop to service center. You would have to bear a huge cost for that.. around 15k to 25+k.. which means you need to buy a brand new laptop.In one word, ""Waste of Money""."
3.0 out of 5 stars,There is a saying in our language which tells us everything degrades over time but I did not expect this to be true for an apple laptop of less than a year.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal.

As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes!

So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad.

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.

The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God!

I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there.

Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue.

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."

Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook.

I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it.

It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon .

Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal.

I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal.

Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it.

I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there.

I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"

You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon .

The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.

You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"

Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.

1.0 out of 5 stars,This was not a computer. I was tricked. I paid $900 for a USB bracelet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook.Let me begin with some of the things that I love:• The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well.• The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users.• The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it.• Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem.Now for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop.• The screen: It is 2019 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere.• No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it.• Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide.• The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option.In conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you.If you think my review is interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful."" I always enjoy writing reviews on products. I make most of my daily purchases on Amazon and base my purchases on reviews from others. I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back.
