4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall,  a very impressive computer.  I use it for part time business and personal use. My only complaint is I purchased it with the Microsoft office 365. It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wireless card could not consistently maintain a connection. It would stayed connected anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes then drop the connection. I have much higher expectations for an expensive high end computer. I spent 2 hours on the phone with Dell technical support until they finally told me to return the laptop.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the new positioning of webcam, and I was a bit worried a bit about the cooler fan sounds before I bought due to previous version's problems, however this is extremely satisfactory product.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally figured out that if you shut the computer down it is possible to charge this computer using a standard phone charger.  If you leave the computer running and/or just close screen standard chargers do not have enough power to charge this compute  There are 12V chargers that are supposed to be able charge this computer while it is running or you can get a DC to 120V AC converter and use the standard charger.I really like the 4K display and am so happy I got a touch screen.  It is just so natural to want to click the screen.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a computer to finish my thesis project and continue working as a software developer.I am very happy with this Dell, it is the first time I experience something premium. I always had Acer and this time I had the pleasure of investing in something that I really like in every way, and I was not mistaken!The screen works great for me, but i need better glasses because some applicactions buttons and text looks very small.The touchpad is wonderful, it feels accurate and smooooth, bear in mind that i was an Acer user hehe.The keyboard is awesome too, it invites you to write. Im still getting use to it because before always had the numeric section and this is the first time that I dont have that.Yes, the speakers can be small and have no bass: I'm really not interested in this aspect, since I was looking for a good laptop, not a stereo. But anyway, it is the only reproach I could have.The performance is great, the power up time is matter of few seconds. I can browser and keep many applications running without ""gettin stuck"" effects.I have no proved it with games.If you want the best windows laptop for work or study, buy a dell xps

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.

It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

Im still getting use to it because before always had the numeric section and this is the first time that I dont have that.Yes, the speakers can be small and have no bass: I'm really not interested in this aspect, since I was looking for a good laptop, not a stereo.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

I always had Acer and this time I had the pleasure of investing in something that I really like in every way, and I was not mistaken!The screen works great for me, but i need better glasses because some applicactions buttons and text looks very small.The touchpad is wonderful, it feels accurate and smooooth, bear in mind that i was an Acer user hehe.The keyboard is awesome too, it invites you to write. Im still getting use to it because before always had the numeric section and this is the first time that I dont have that.Yes, the speakers can be small and have no bass: I'm really not interested in this aspect, since I was looking for a good laptop, not a stereo. But anyway, it is the only reproach I could have.The performance is great, the power up time is matter of few seconds. I can browser and keep many applications running without ""gettin stuck"" effects.I have no proved it with games.If you want the best windows laptop for work or study, buy a dell xps

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall,  a very impressive computer.  I use it for part time business and personal use. My only complaint is I purchased it with the Microsoft office 365. It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them.

Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Dell guy, so I'm not here to flame their products. Laptop is built solid. Any XPS machine exhibits that trait. I find the keyboard quick and responsive, including enough depth. I have the high res screen and it's a beauty...My only ding are the speakers. Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved this laptop. The screen is amazing. It's small, extremely light, and feels sturdy. It's super fast. The problem is that the USB ports flat out don't work. When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

When the machine boots, all three will charge and one of the three will provide USB-C connectivity. I re-installed all drivers and even the OS (Win 10) 3 times, with the same result. Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them.

Hours of searching online revealed that USB ports not working on this model is a common problem. For some people, they will work for a while and then stop, and then start again. I really liked this computer but I sadly had to send it back as I require all the ports to work whenever I need them. This machine has so many great features but is a 2 star because of the most basic of failures - reliable USB ports.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about this machine. It is light, fast, solid construction and gorgeous. The 4K touch screen is well worth the money. I tried to configure a machine on Dell's website. For the same price, getting it on Amazon gave me the i7 and 16MB od RAM. Most amazing, I got it 2 weeks sooner than Dell estimated.

It never installed and I had to purchase it a second time because I had to have it for work.  Very annoying and additional cost. Do not get software ""preloaded"". It isn't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Dell person and have been for many years.  I just upgraded from this version of laptop which I had bought 3 years ago.  I had to buy a new one as the battery in my old one was about to explode.  I learned an important lesson:  Always check to make sure the area around the mouse on the key board is completely flat.  As soon as you see any unevenness, get rid of it as the battery is close to exploding.  The new laptop is really great.  it is so much faster than my old one - no comparison.  The picture quality is excellent as is the touch screen.  You turn it on with finger print ID.  I miss the USB port but I guess no one makes them any more.

Volume output is sub-par, but worse than than that, no bass, sounds like my old transistor radio. For such an expensive unit, don't know why they dropped the ball on the audio.
