5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well.

Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop.

The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.

It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well.

Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.

The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use.

Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications.

If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight.

If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.

I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications.

If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.

I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either.

The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware.

            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud.

As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised.

A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred.

Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised.

A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised.

A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot.

Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.

I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system.

I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.

This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.

Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.

For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.

This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.

The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo.

            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know!

I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications.

If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.

I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Eventually got it to actually type 1. Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time. Returning this!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.

For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned this in frustration. The advertised ""Super Bright"" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love: the fit and finish is beautiful.  The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.  The feel of the keys is just right - not too much or too little travel.  The trackpad is larger than the original Flip, which I like.  It tracks well.  The touch screen is responsive to touch as well as the transition to tablet mode.  I really like how the hinges have different tension so the feet on the bottom of the screen go down first when using it in laptop mode but it still converts fully to a flat tablet.  I also like how the bottom part with the keyboard tapers towards the edge, give you a more traditional keyboard slant.  Running multiple tabs in up to 3 windows while also having at least two apps open I saw no slow down.  I can confirm that you can charge the Chromebook with the same charger you use for newer Android phones (USB-C chargers) and you can even use a portable back up battery though both of these will charge slowly. Still, it's a good option in a pinch.Cons: That same keyboard slant means it doesn't fold back complete flush when in table mode, so there's a little bit of flex, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The slot for the microSD card is just a touch too shallow.  On two occasions the microSD card was accidently pressed and popped out.  The texture on the keys is just slightly different than the texture on the body, making the paint look a little different.  This is extremely minor, but for the money I would have like to have seen a more consistent finish.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop/notebook computer as well. The main reason I purchased this model is because I'd read reviews of a previous model by Asus - the Flip 302. It was always highly rated. I also own an Asus AIO desktop PC which has been great. I am not a power user by any stretch but I think this model will offer plenty of bang for my intended usage.I run a new non-profit chapter of a national organization where all technology is online and in the cloud. I don't particularly like using a laptop computer so I've already purchased an external monitor and BT Logitech keyboard. Such a huge difference for me. As for the Chromebook itself; in my opinion it's a premium product in all regards. The build is excellent and it seems/feels/looks like a much more expensive product. Even though it's only 4mb of ram I think this will be plenty for my use. I especially like the screen. It's bright and has very slim bezel. Just looks right.You might be asking why did I buy a laptop when I don't really like them. The reason is because I will on occasion need to take it on the road or to a meeting. I will also use the flip screen at times to show charts, graphs, videos, etc.to prospective donors. I'll also use the 434 Flip at fundraisers when I can hook it up to a projection system. The photo above is my temporary setup as of yesterday to try the new external monitor and keyboard. BTW - my KB isn't a Chrome specific type. I also purchased an inexpensive external 2TB hard drive. Plug & Play simple. I've also connected an HP Officejet Pro printer wirelessly. No problem at all setting that up. The BT connections for both the KB and mouse were a snap to setup and work great. As our office expands I will probably purchase a ChromeBox or two.Chrombooks and I'd guess by extension a Chrome Box are very simple to use and work well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box. The Asus 434 Flip is very nice piece of equipment and I expect many years of service from it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.After a few minutes, the touch-screen would freeze and trackpad would stop working. I would then have to reboot. A few minutes later, touch-screen would freeze again, trackpad would stop working. I'd have to reboot. After a 3rd time,I performed a hard reset which at first solved the issue but a few minutes later, the same problem occurred. At which point I contacted Amazon and subsequently returned the chromebook for a refund with no problems. Amazon was great and efficient.Aside from the malfunctions,  I liked everything about the unit: size, shape, weight, touchscreen and keyboard.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. Under dark, the letters are backlit but very dim, a lot of lights leak from edges between the keys unexpectedly. The key stroke strength and click sound are just OK however not excellent. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.

Got it fully setup for my mom who was going to be using it and then it happened again and this time when i rebooted i couldn't get any numbers or backspace to work again which means I couldn't unlock the computer either. Did a powerwash and the issue with the numbers remained. Was every number but 5 & 6. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.
